# 👋 Hey, I’m Purnima  

💡 Engineer · ML Explorer · Future Product Strategist  
Currently a Master’s student in Computer Science (MPCS) @ **University of Chicago**  

---

### 🚀 What I Do
- Build **intelligent systems** → simulation, automation, and data-driven insights  
- Experiment with **ML models** that solve real-world problems  
- Think at the **intersection of data + product strategy**  

---

### 🔬 Featured Projects  
🌱 **Plant Disease Detection**  
> CNN + Focal Loss + ResNet → Boosted accuracy from 78% → **92%** on 50k+ image dataset  
*(Practical edge: early detection saves yield + farmers’ time)*  

🌾 **Crop Forecasting with SARIMA**  
> Forecasted crop yield cycles using NDVI vegetation data + SARIMA  
*(Because forecasting food is cooler than forecasting stock prices 🌽)*

### 🛠️ Toolbox
`Python` · `TensorFlow` · `Keras` · `Scikit-learn` · `SystemC`  
`Pandas` · `SQL` · `Docker` · `Spring Boot` · `OpenCV`

### ✨ Currently
- Exploring **AI/ML** and product strategy at UChicago  
- Seeking opportunities to **build, learn, and impact** (Summer ’26 internships 👀)

📌 *Fun fact: I treat my projects like products. If they don’t solve a real problem, they don’t make the cut.*
